When we refer to certain people as being "personalities," we usually mean they are famous, people like movie stars or your favorite band. When we describe a person as having "lots of personality," we usually mean they are outgoing and fun-loving, the kind of person we like to spend time with. But does this tell us anything about personality itself? Although we may think we have an understanding of what personality is, professional psychologists always seek to move beyond what people think they know in order to determine what is actually real or at least as close to real as we can come. In the pursuit of truly understanding personality, however, many personality theorists seem to have been focused on a particularly Western cultural approach that owes much of its history to the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud."--Open Textbook Library.},

Approaching consciousness from diverse disciplinary perspectives—philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, neuropathology, psychotherapy, biology, animal ethology, and physics—the contributors offer empirical and philosophical support for a model of consciousness inspired by the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947). Whitehead's model is developed in ways he could not have anticipated to show how it can advance current debates beyond well-known sticking points. This has trenchant consequences for epistemology and suggests fresh and promising new perspectives on such topics as the mind-body problem, the neurobiology of consciousness, animal consciousness, the evolution of consciousness, panpsychism, the unity of consciousness, epiphenomenalism, free will, and causation.},

First, empirical evidence shows that brain activity not only influences, but is in turn influenced by, physical activity taking place in other parts of the organism (such as the endocrine and immune systems). It is therefore not clear why the core machinery of moods ought to be restricted to the brain. I propose, instead, that moods should be conceived as embodied, i.e., their physical basis should be enlarged so as to comprise not just brain but also bodily processes. Second, I emphasise that moods are also situated in the world. By this I do not simply mean that moods are influenced by the world, but that they are complexly interrelated with it, in at least three different ways: they are shaped by cultural values and norms; they are materially and intersubjectively “scaffolded”; and they can even “experientially incorporate” parts of the world, i.e., include the experience of parts of the world as part of oneself.},

@book{Deacon1997,
abstract = {This revolutionary book offers fresh answers to long? standing questions of human origins and consciousness. Drawing on his breakthrough research in comparative neuroscience, Terrence Deacon shows that: • The evolution of language did not involve a language organ or instinct, and did not result simply from a larg? er, more complex brain. •• Language reflected a new mode of thinking: symbolic thinking. • Symbolic thinking triggered a co-evolutionary exchange between languages and brains over two mil? lion years of hominid evolution-"Many of the physical {\textperiodcentered} traits that distinguish human bodies and brains were ultimately caused by ideas shared down the genera? tions." • The grammars of the world's languages are remarkably similar and, despite their complexity, are easily learned by young children, not because of innate grammatical knowledge but because languages have themselves evolved structural adaptations to human cognitive con? straints, particularly those of immature brains. •• The first symbolic communication evolved as the only means our hominid ancestors had to overcome the evo? lutionary difficulties of combining long-term sexual exclusivity, mostly in pair bonds, with cooperative group foraging, which became a critical factor with the utiliza? tion of animal foods. • The reorganization of the brain for language brought with it many indirect and serendipitous consequences, including unprecedented vocal control, unusual "innate" calls like laughter and sobbing, a susceptibility to such mental disorders as schizophrenia and autism, and a compulsion to assign symbolic import to almost every aspect of the physical world. •• An understanding of symbolic communication allows us to reinterpret such aspects of consciousness as ratio? nal intention, meaning, belief, and self-consciousness as emergent properties of the virtual world created by sym? bols. It also points the way to building machines that don't just manipulate symbols, but understand them. • Symbolic abilities created a species that for the first time in the history of life had access to others' thoughts and emotions-and thus confronted an ethical dimen? sion to social behavior.

If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism--the mirror-neuron mechanism--that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

After a brief introduction to Baldwin's career, this article describes the intellectual context within which his evolutionary thinking developed. Three of his most important contributions are then discussed: his theory of individual adaptation or learning, his concept of "social heredity," and his articulation of the "Baldwin effect."

If it is true, it is not reasonable to hope that a formalised language like that used by computers may be a model for thought. Finally, the lack of status of thought, as far as it is a subjective experience and the impossibility of giving it a definition as far as it exceeds language, make it clear that in spite of progress in scientific psychology, thought, per se, is not an object for science. {\textcopyright} 1992 Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd.},

It includes coverage of the organization of academic psychology in the Soviet Union, the network of scholars associated with Vygotsky in the interwar period, and the assumed publication ban on Vygotsky's writings. This volume is the first to provide an overview of revisionist studies of Vygotsky's work, and is the product of close international collaboration between revisionist scholars.

abstract = {The scientific work of Lev S. Vygotsky has had a remarkable destiny. The man himself, one of the greatest psychologists of the twentieth century, never received any formal training in psychology. His death at the age of 37 put an end to his research after only ten years or so, and he did not see the publication of his most important works. And yet this 'Mozart of psychology' (as the philosopher S. Toulmin called him) constructed one of the most promising theories in psychology. More than fifty years after his death, now that his major works have been published, Vygotsky has become an avant-garde writer. According to one of his best exponents, 'There is no doubt that, in many respects, Vygotsky is far ahead of our own time' (Rivi{\`{e}}re, 1984, p. 120). Such a phenomenon, so rare in the history of science, may perhaps be explained by two closely connected factors: first, the scope and originality of his scientific writings over a relatively short period offer clear proof of his genius. Second, he was working at a time of dramatic historical change, namely the October Revolution in Russia. At the heart of the psychological system constructed by Vygotsky we find an ontogenetic theory of mental development that is also in many aspects a historical theory of individual development. In other words, it is a genetic conception of a genetic phenomenon. No doubt there is an epistemological lesson to be drawn from this: it would seem that historical periods of revolutionary change sharpen the sensitivity of human thought and predispose it in favour of everything that concerns genesis, transformation, dynamic evolution and the future.},

Through outlining core principles in Marxist psychology, the book offers a framework for continuing Vygotsky's Marxist legacy in new areas of the field. This book first documents the neglect in Vygotskyian studies of his deep use of Marxist concepts, and then subsequent chapters overcome this neglect. They explain the use of many Marxist concepts in his theoretical and methodological writings, demonstrating how Vygotsky utilized specific Marxist meanings in his work on consciousness, signs, development, imagination, creativity, secondary language acquisition, and unit of analysis. Chapters also address how Vygotsky dealt with incompatible theories and methodologies, illustrating how Marxist and Vygotskyian psychology can grow from anti-Marxist, anti-Vygotskyian approaches to psychology, such as psychoanalysis. This book marks an original contribution to the field of psychology, offering a new understanding of both Vygotsky's work and cultural and Marxist psychology. Furthermore, it expands the field of Marxism to include psychology.

abstract = {The essence of consciousness: entity, activity, or relation? Consciousness is one of the most “inconvenient” objects of psychological research. It is so evasive and idiosyncratic that the investigation of consciousness can be compared with the study of the footprints that appear on the sand at the beach and are immediately washed away. One cannot “touch,” “weigh,” or “capture” consciousness – and not only so because consciousness is ever changing. Psychology, as well as philosophy, keeps wondering whether consciousness as a phenomenon exists as such. If it is only a sum of other psychological processes or a side effect, an epiphenomenon, that accompanies such processes, then the legitimacy of the quest for the specific characteristics of consciousness is fairly questionable. Indeed, is it worthwhile to create a theory of something that does not exist? American philosopher and psychologist William James was perhaps the first who raised this question in psychology in his treatise “Does ‘consciousness' exist?” (1904), in which he argued that “it is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first principles,” and, therefore, proclaimed that “the hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded” (James, 1904, p. 477). James' proposition might seem absurd since it is just contrary to our personal experience. In everyday life we do not doubt that consciousness exists and that we do have it. We know that one can “lose” or “regain” consciousness, it can be “full,” “growing,” and “altered,” or flow in a “stream,” but in any case, in terms of folk psychology, it is definitely recognized as something actually existing in the world. However, for scientific psychology the ontological, existential status of consciousness has always been unclear and problematic.},

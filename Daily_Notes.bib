abstract = {At first glance, C. G. Jung and Alfred North Whitehead might seem to have little in common. On the one hand, Jung spent the formative years of his early career working as a psychiatrist in a mental institution, during which time he began his eight-year association with Freud, which resulted in Jung playing a large, and often unacknowledged, role in the early promulgation of psychoanalysis. Over the half-century following his break with Freud, Jung built his own approach to depth psychology that engaged primarily with the psychological reality of fantasy images, myths, and dreams. On the other hand, Whitehead had a full career as an influential mathematician, writing the seminal book on modern mathematics, Principia Mathematica, near the beginning of the twentieth century with his student Bertrand Russell. In his sixties, Whitehead made the shift to philosophy, specifically metaphysical cosmology, though he always retained the rigorous and abstract approach characteristic of mathematics, a level of precision that philosophers have often sought to emulate. Thus, on the surface, it would seem that Jung's engagement with psyche and Whitehead's engagement with cosmos have virtually nothing in common. However, as this implicit reference to Richard Tarnas's Cosmos and Psyche indicates, the deepest intimations of their psychology and cosmology, respectively, seem to suggest a convergence of these two thinkers' projects. Indeed, as I have read their work over the years, I have increasingly come to see profound connections between their ideas, particularly between Jung's concept of archetypes,},

abstract = {The unconscious is the residue of unconquered nature in us, just as it is also the matrix of our unborn future. (Jung, Psychological Types {\S}907) Introduction Our approach to Rational Intuition reflects the shared purpose of other chapters in this volume: to explore and articulate the relationship between rationality and intuition. Both Carl Gustav Jung and Alfred North Whitehead were conversant with the history of these terms. In Jung's view, thinking and feeling are aspects of what he called the “rational functions,” while intuition and sensation are aspects of the nonrational, or what he called the “irrational functions” of the psyche – where psyche refers to “the totality of all psychic processes, conscious as well as unconscious” (Jung, 1921, p.463 {\S}797). Whitehead's philosophy emphasized feeling over the other functions. In their discussion of traditional mental functions, both followed the general direction laid out by Aristotle and the epistemological traditions that grew out of his writings on logic and rhetoric. However, each introduced innovations in order to address specific philosophical issues of interest to them. Terms such as intuition, sensation, feeling, and thinking have a very long history in both common language and the technical discourse of philosophy. A comparison of Jung and Whitehead on the issue of rational intuition in the span of a single chapter is challenging, given the divergence of their original and sometimes idiosyncratic use of terms. Looking beyond obvious differences, certain features of their intellectual stance reveal agreement in spirit: both delighted in openly exploring a given topic in the course of explaining it; their thoughts often recurred to the unresolved complexities they have created in framing the topic; and both were unrelentingly empirical. Both men were concerned about the polarities generated by the European Enlightenment, both strove to heal the bifurcation of human life into mental and physical realms.},

Whitehead's model is developed in ways he could not have anticipated to show how it can advance current debates beyond well-known sticking points. This has trenchant consequences for epistemology and suggests fresh and promising new perspectives on such topics as the mind-body problem, the neurobiology of consciousness, animal consciousness, the evolution of consciousness, panpsychism, the unity of consciousness, epiphenomenalism, free will, and causation.},

abstract = {In Panpsychism in the West, the first comprehensive study of the subject, David Skrbina argues for the importance of panpsychism -- the theory that mind exists, in some form, in all living and nonliving things -- in consideration of the nature of consciousness and mind. Panpsychism, with its conception of mind as a general phenomenon of nature, uniquely links being and mind. More than a theory of mind, it is a meta-theory -- a statement about theories of mind rather than a theory in itself. Panpsychism can parallel almost every current theory of mind; it simply holds that, no matter how one conceives of mind, such mind applies to all things. After a brief discussion of general issues surrounding philosophy of mind, Skrbina examines the panpsychist views of philosophers from the pre-Socratics to the post-structuralists. The original edition of Panpsychism in the West helped to reinvigorate a neglected and important aspect of philosophic thinking. This revised edition offers expanded and updated material that reflects the growth of panpsychism as a subdiscipline. It covers the problem of emergence of mind from a non-mental reality and the combination problem in greater detail. It offers expanded coverage of the pre-Socratics and Plato; a new section on Augustine; expanded discussions of Continental panpsychism, scientific arguments, Nietzsche, and Whitehead; and a new section on Russellian monism. With this edition, Panpsychism in the West will be continue to be the standard work on the topic.},

abstract = {The nature of consciousness, the mechanism by which it occurs in the brain, and its ultimate place in the universe are unknown. We proposed in the mid 1990's that consciousness depends on biologically 'orchestrated' coherent quantum processes in collections of microtubules within brain neurons, that these quantum processes correlate with, and regulate, neuronal synaptic and membrane activity, and that the continuous Schr{\"{o}}dinger evolution of each such process terminates in accordance with the specific Di{\'{o}}si-Penrose (DP) scheme of 'objective reduction' ('OR') of the quantum state. This orchestrated OR activity ('Orch OR') is taken to result in moments of conscious awareness and/or choice. The DP form of OR is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and space-time geometry, so Orch OR suggests that there is a connection between the brain's biomolecular processes and the basic structure of the universe. Here we review Orch OR in light of criticisms and developments in quantum biology, neuroscience, physics and cosmology. We also introduce a novel suggestion of 'beat frequencies' of faster microtubule vibrations as a possible source of the observed electro-encephalographic ('EEG') correlates of consciousness. We conclude that consciousness plays an intrinsic role in the universe. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We surely wont be able to get through the whole of Being and Nothingness in this one semester. Nevertheless, we should get far enough along that, by the time we are done, you will have the background to be able to read the rest of the book on your own if you should wish to. And you should wish to. In my judgment, Being and Nothingness is probably the single best piece of philosophy written in the 20th century. That is a strong claim, and I dont make it lightly. There is lots of good philosophy in the 20th century, but this book has a kind of sweep and scope that, as far as I know, no other work has in this century. There may be exceptions for example, Heideggers Being and Time, which I do not know well but within the limits of my knowledge, Being and Nothingness stands out as without serious competition.},

@article{Tononi2015,
abstract = {The science of consciousness has made great strides by focusing on the behavioural and neuronal correlates of experience. However, while such correlates are important for progress to occur, they are not enough if we are to understand even basic facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not, though it has even more neurons and appears to be just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of little help in many instances where we would like to know if consciousness is present: patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To address these issues, we need not only more data but also a theory of consciousness—one that says what experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated information theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover,IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory findings, makes a number of testable predictions and extrapolates to a number of problematic conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a fundamental property possessed by physical systems having specific causal properties. It predicts that consciousness is graded, is common among biological organisms and can occur in some very simple systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor are aggregates such as groups of individuals or heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their behaviour were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This volume explores the relevance of Pauli's visionary ideas with respect to several topics in science and philosophy that are if great contemporary interest: the role of symmetries in theoretical science; dual-aspect approaches to the mind-brain problem; the tension between psychological and physical time; the nature of creative activity and the origin of mathematical insight; and adaptive mutations and epigenetics in biology. Today we are in a position to appreciate how relevant Pauli's work and speculations have turned out to be. This book, authored by a team of internationally renowned experts, provides material and suggests directions for future studies of a variety of deep-seated and open problems, in particular concerning the relation between mind and matter. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract = {To reach the UN sustainable development goal, there is a need for comprehensive and robust tools to help decision-making identify the solutions that best support sustainable development. The decisions must have a system perspective, consider the life cycle, and all relevant impacts caused by the solution. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool that has these characteristics and the ambition with this book is to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the tool and its underlying methodological considerations and potential applications. The book consists of five parts. The first part introduces LCA. The second part is a text book aiming at university students from undergraduate to PhD level, and professionals from industry and within policy making. It follows ISO 14040/14044 structure, draws upon a variety of LCA methods published over the years, especially the ILCD, and offers prescriptions and recommendations for all the most important methodological choices that you meet when performing an LCA. The third part introduces applications of LCA and life cycle thinking by policy- and decision-makers in government and industry. The fourth part is a Cookbook guiding you through the concrete actions to undertake when performing an LCA. The fifth part contains some appendices. The book can be used as a text book, the chapter can be read as stand alone, and you can use the Cookbook as a manual on how to perform an LCA.},

abstract = {This paper examines the central theoretical concepts in the work of Rupert Sheldrake. The first section examines Sheldrake's account of morphic fields and questions whether difficulties arise when these concepts are extended upwards from the biological level. The second section reviews Sheldrake's concept of extended mind and considers the criticism that it is reductionist about mentality. In considering both of these criticisms it is argued that Sheldrake's theories can be taken in a reductive direction, but need not be. The third and final section draws on the work of Joseph Bracken and David Ray Griffin to suggest a panpsychist metaphysics of field as one possible way that Sheldrake could sidestep these dangers and strengthen his approach.},

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

@incollection{Pribram1980,
abstract = {The history of psychology in this century can be charted in terms of the issue that dominated each decade of exploration. Early studies on classi-cal conditioning and Gestalt principles of perception were followed sub-sequently by two decades of behaviorism. In the 1950s information mea-surement took the stage to be supplanted in the 1960s by an almost frenetic endeavor to catalogue memory processes, an endeavor which culminated in the new concepts of a cognitive psychology. Currently, the study of consciousness as central to the mind-brain problem has emerged from the explorations of altered and alternative states produced by drugs, meditation, and a variety of other techniques designed to promote psychological growth. Each of these new departures built upon old foundations but at the same time challenged and changed the dogma that had solidified to identify those foundations. The environmentalism of conditioning was countered by the nativism of Gestalt. The holism of Gestalt was leavened by the operationism of behavior. The peripheralism of S-R behavior theory gave way to the feedbacks of cybernetics and the correlational descriptive functionalism of both became quickly obsolete in the face of the new process oriented structuralism of cognitive psychology . The purpose of this chapter is to examine the impact that the study of consciousness must make on the conceptions of current structuralism. True to tradition this impact ought to derive from an examination of the structure of consciousness, while at the same time challenging the ;.. dogma that has developed to characterize current thought. At any period in history, the characteristic dogma is ordinarily im-" plicit and therefore must be made explicit if a challenge is to succeed in making modifications. Originally, structuralism took as its model the digital computer and the programs that make it operational (Miller, Gal-anter, & Pribram, 1960; Pribram, 1960). As such, it is rooted in both the earlier functionalism of behavioral psychology and in information pro-cessing. Information is conceived in terms of features or alternatives that describe a situation, and processing proceeds by associations or list structure hierarchies among alternative features. The operations in-volved in processing are digital. In the computer, they result from switch settings; in the biological brain from convergences of nerve im-pulses onto a neuronal switching mechanism (e.g., Pitts & McCulloch, 1947; Pribram, 1971, Chap. 4). The refreshing power of this modelin the development of a cognitive psychology and of an information process-ing approach to brain function cannot be denied. But certain inadequacies remain. The information processing ap-proach cannot account for the richness and immediacy of imaging. Nor does it by itself, handle the problem of meaning, of the semantic deep structure of language. Current cognitive structuralism also does not satisfactorily address itself to the nature of feelings, the emotions and motivations that are the substance of clinical psychology-though a clas-sical cognitive clinical psychology (which takes into account the issues delineated below) exists in the form of the psychoanalytic metapsychol-ogy (Pribram & Gill, 1976). One of the central problems is that an information processing ap-proach based on nerve impulse transmission ignores the vast number of neurons that do not generate nerve impulses (Pribram, 1971, Chap. 1). Such neurons are often without axons but display widespreading dend-ritic arborizations. They function by hyperpolarization and depolariza-tion to produce graded inhibition or excitation in their immediate sur-roundings. The retina is made up exclusively of such neurons until the ganglion cell layer is reached. Only here is the digital nerve impuse pro-duced which allows Signals to be transmitted over the distance traversed by the optic nerve and tract. The computations that give rise to these digital signals (and, therefore, vision) all occur in the analogue domain via graded interactions in receptor networks of horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells. Studies of the analogue interactions occurring in other a.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished. This purpose demands more account of general history than is usually given by historians of philosophy. I have found this particularly necessary as regards periods with which the general reader cannot be assumed to be familiar. The great age of the scholastic philosophy was an outcome of the reforms of the eleventh century, and these, in turn, were a reaction against previous corruption. Without some knowledge of the centuries between the fall of Rome and the rise of the medieval Papacy, the intellectual atmosphere of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries can hardly be understood. In dealing with this period, as with others, I have aimed at giving only so much general history as I thought necessary for the sympathetic comprehension of philosophers in relation to the times that formed them and the times that they helped to form.},

abstract = {This new edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5?), used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders, is the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5? easier to use across all settings: ? The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. ? The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations.? The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. ? Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders).? Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided.? Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations. The information contained in the manual is also valuable to other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@book{Jung1973,
abstract = {Jung was intrigued from early in his career with coincidences, especially those surprising juxtapositions that scientific rationality could not adequately explain. He discussed these ideas with Albert Einstein before World War I, but first used the term "synchronicity" in a 1930 lecture, in reference to the unusual psychological insights generated from consulting the I Ching. A long correspondence and friendship with the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli stimulated a final, mature statement of Jung's thinking on synchronicity, originally published in 1952 and reproduced here. Together with a wealth of historical and contemporary material, this essay describes an astrological experiment Jung conducted to test his theory. Synchronicity reveals the full extent of Jung's research into a wide range of psychic phenomena. This paperback edition of Jung's classic work includes a new foreword by Sonu Shamdasani, Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London. Related research},

@book{Deacon1997,
abstract = {This revolutionary book offers fresh answers to long? standing questions of human origins and consciousness. Drawing on his breakthrough research in comparative neuroscience, Terrence Deacon shows that: • The evolution of language did not involve a language organ or instinct, and did not result simply from a larg? er, more complex brain. •• Language reflected a new mode of thinking: symbolic thinking. • Symbolic thinking triggered a co-evolutionary exchange between languages and brains over two mil? lion years of hominid evolution-"Many of the physical {\textperiodcentered} traits that distinguish human bodies and brains were ultimately caused by ideas shared down the genera? tions." • The grammars of the world's languages are remarkably similar and, despite their complexity, are easily learned by young children, not because of innate grammatical knowledge but because languages have themselves evolved structural adaptations to human cognitive con? straints, particularly those of immature brains. •• The first symbolic communication evolved as the only means our hominid ancestors had to overcome the evo? lutionary difficulties of combining long-term sexual exclusivity, mostly in pair bonds, with cooperative group foraging, which became a critical factor with the utiliza? tion of animal foods. • The reorganization of the brain for language brought with it many indirect and serendipitous consequences, including unprecedented vocal control, unusual "innate" calls like laughter and sobbing, a susceptibility to such mental disorders as schizophrenia and autism, and a compulsion to assign symbolic import to almost every aspect of the physical world. •• An understanding of symbolic communication allows us to reinterpret such aspects of consciousness as ratio? nal intention, meaning, belief, and self-consciousness as emergent properties of the virtual world created by sym? bols. It also points the way to building machines that don't just manipulate symbols, but understand them. • Symbolic abilities created a species that for the first time in the history of life had access to others' thoughts and emotions-and thus confronted an ethical dimen? sion to social behavior.
